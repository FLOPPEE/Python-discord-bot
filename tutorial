The recommended website to use this code is replit.com,any app or website that is compatible with advanced coding like visual coding studio would work aswell.
Make sure when you make a repl to choose PYTHON not anything else.
When you make a repl paste the code in the file main.
After that run the bot and will start to download some files and that is normal and after it finishes you will get a something saying "Discord bot online" and your bot will be online.
If you have any problems dm me on discord FLOPPEE#0021.
